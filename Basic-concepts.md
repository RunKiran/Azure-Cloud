    Cloud computing is a technology model that involves the delivery of computing services over the internet,Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers and infrastructure users can access and use computing resources,application and storage provided by either third-party service provders(Public-cloud) or their own organization(Private cloud) through the internet.These services are hosted in data centers located around world.
    The flexibility of cloud computing allows organizations to choose the deployment model that best aligns with their needs and requirements. 

Public Cloud:
      Who uses it: Everyone like individuals,bussiness and organizations
      What It's Like: shared computer space on the internet. It's like using apps, storing files, or doing tasks on the internet that anyone can access.

Private Cloud:
Who Uses It: One specific organization or business.

What It's Like: Picture having your own personal, private computer space. It's like a digital clubhouse where only you and your team have access. Others can't just drop in.

Example: A company using its own server for all its digital needs.

Hybrid Cloud:
Who Uses It: A mix of everyone, depending on needs.

What It's Like: It's like having your private computer space, but sometimes you use the shared internet space too.
