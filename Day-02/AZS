Exploring Regions and Availability Zones in Azure:

Regions in Azure:

Azure is a cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft, and it is globally distributed across multiple geographic locations known as regions. Each Azure region is a set of data centers deployed within a defined geographic area, and it is designed to provide low-latency access to Azure services for users and applications in that region.

Key Points about Azure Regions:

Global Presence: Azure has a vast global presence with data centers strategically located around the world.

Region Pairing: Azure regions are often paired for data redundancy and resiliency. In the event of a regional failure, paired regions can help ensure continuity.

Compliance and Data Residency: Organizations can choose specific regions to comply with data residency requirements and regulations.
